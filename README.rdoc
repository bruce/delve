Simple API to access information on Ruby 1.9+ objects and methods.

== Synopsis

This is essentially an experiment with the 'ripper' library present in
Ruby 1.9.  The library is *very* experimental, and may never become anything
worth using.  Mostly it's an educational tool for me.

Documentation really doesn't exist yet.  Feel free to look at +examples/+ or
the tests for now.

Supports:
* Seeing the filename & line number where classes, modules, and methods are defined
  * Including when they're reopened
* Seeing the associated comment (documentation) where classes, modules, and methods

Planned:
* Extraction of class, module, and method contents
* Heuristics, as I find them interesting

== Requirements

* Ruby >= 1.9.0
* Echoe & Shoulda (development only)

== License
