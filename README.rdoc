= Delve

Simple API to access information on Ruby 1.9+ objects and methods.

== Synopsis

This is essentially an experiment with the 'ripper' library present in
Ruby 1.9.  The library is *very* experimental, and may never become anything
worth using.  Mostly it's an educational tool for me.

Documentation really doesn't exist yet.  Feel free to look at +examples/+ or
the tests for now.

Supports:
* Seeing the filename, line number, and associated comment where classes, modules, and methods are defined
  * Including when they're reopened

Planned:
* Extraction of class, module, and method contents
* Heuristics, as I find them interesting

Known Issues:
* Delve is stupid when it comes to mixins; you can't try to lookup
  a method that's mixed into a class, for instance, by TheClass#the_method,
  you need to look it up by TheMixin#the_method

== Example

Really, you should see examples/, but here's a quick way to look up
information on something, using ActiveRecord as an example.

  require 'activerecord'
  
  require 'delve/required'

  # This returns an Array of matching results
  # You can look for:
  # * Constants::Like::This
  # * Some::Constants#instance_method
  # * A::Class.method_too
  # * Or::A::Class::method_invoked_old_skool_like_this
  results = Delve['ActiveRecord::Base.find']

  # For each time the method was defined, show the related comment
  results.each do |result|
    puts result.comment
    # You could check its 'filename' or 'line', too.
  end

== Requirements

* Ruby >= 1.9.0
* Echoe & Shoulda (development only)
